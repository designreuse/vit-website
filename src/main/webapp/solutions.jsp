Our SharePoint consultants can analyze your needs, provide recommendations in regard to which and how much SharePoint customization may be necessary and worth applying, and then implement such customizations.</p>

Due to the remoteness of the locations, network connectivity in depots is a challenge, so till date depot staff relies on manual way of stock keeping. VITMobile framework resolves this issue and allows user to collect the informations at the point of occurrence in both connected as well as disconnected mode. Using this application only new information needs to be entered at different stage of depot operations. The depot in charge can view any kind of reports or generate receipts at a click of a button and if needed print them via portable Bluetooth printers.</li></ul></p>
