                                        <p>During the several Mining/Manufacturing operations, typically data is captured on a piece of paper, which is then propagated to the ledgers or system later. Tracking of valuable goods transportation/ vehicle itself done through phone calls or messaging. This is inherently because a Desktop cannot be made available at the places where the data is captured. No GPS system is in place to enable runtime tracking of the vehicles. With the emergence of new portable mobile devices, it is prudent that this practice is replaced with a more efficient way where the redundancies can be eliminated and the accuracy of data capture and tracking can be improved.</p>

                                        <p id="sub-h">Business Case</p>

                                        <p>A customer of VIT who is Automobile major having deployed a legacy SharePoint application was looking to integrate an external BPM solution to enhance the functionality of the deployed application. This enhancement had to respect the existing user experience and integrate seamlessly by continuing to honor the existing SharePoint workflow functionality (e.g., Initiating on Demand and Canceling).</p>

                                        <p id="sub-h">The Challenge</p>
                                        <p>Some of the major constraints placed on this solution were as follows:</p>
                                        <p><ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
                                            <li>The custom workflow in SharePoint should integrate with the external BPMS workflow in a seamless way.</li>
                                            <li>The solution has to respect existing user experience.</li>
                                            <li>Security Trimming: Needs to regard user access rights to either see or initiate actions/task.</li>
                                            <li>Configuration information can be stored in SharePoint, but some specific fields need to be encrypted.</li>
                                            <li>Proposed Solution must adhere to Microsoft SharePoint Customization Policy - Gold Service Level.</li>
                                        </ul></p>

                                                <li>Solution was developed using SharePoint web services and designed to not limit the solution using the SharePoint object model..</li>
                                                <li>Designed a custom SharePoint workflow that can be used against any SharePoint object.</li>
                                                <li>Built a custom workflow activity to enable integration into the external workflow solution.</li>
                                                <li>The user interface associated with the custom workflow had to be based on a SharePoint master page so as to retain the existing user experience</li>
                                                <li>A two-way integration between the external workflow solution and the SharePoint workflow was built to enable cancellation, initiation and other common operations using SharePoint enabled web services.</li>

                                        <p>The solution was built using VIT's GPS Based Fleet Management and VITMobile framework. There are two different Mobile applications one for Ward Supervisor and another for driver of the garbage collection truck were built using the VITMobile framework. The Truck Driver uses the mobile application to receive the list of Community Bins from where the solid waste needs to be picked up and also update the status of the pickup back to the server. The mobile application periodically transmits the GPS coordinates of the truck to the server which tracks the locations of all the trucks. The Ward Supervisor uses the mobile application to track and report the status of the community bins in his ward to the server and also report the attendance of the Community Workers. VIT GPS Application has been configured to trigger a workflow when a Community Bin is reported full, which creates a task for the Operator at the central processing station to process the pickup of that Community Bin. The Operator uses the GPS Web application to track a garbage collection truck near to the Community Bin and assign the pickup job to it. This is immediately notified to the corresponding Truck Driver's mobile application, so that the Truck Driver can act on it. Similarly another workflow is triggered, when the Ward Supervisor reports a wear and tear of the Community Bin, which creates the tasks for the maintenance personnel for the maintenance of the Community Bin.</p>

                                <h3>Firmware Upload Utility & Diagnostic tool for Removable eSATA Hard Disk Drives: Case Studies</h3>
                                <img src="images/harddisk.jpg" width="100%" style="height: 14em; margin-bottom: 12px;">
                                <p id="sub-h">Overview</p>
                                <p>The world's leading provider of removable data storage products designed to help customers create, protect and retrieve valuable digital assets. They have more than 50 years of data storage leadership, beginning with the development of the world's first computer tape.</p>

                                <p id="sub-h">Business Need</p>
                                <p>The eSATA Removable Hard Disk Storage System replaces the older AT Attachment standard offering several advantages over the older interface. eSATA devices comes with reduced cable size and cost (seven conductors instead of 40), native hot swapping, faster data transfer through higher signaling rates, and more efficient transfer through an (optional) I/O queuing protocol. The system is designed to help small offices and home offices meet the escalating challenges of data protection by providing fast backup, accurate restores and full disaster recovery with minimal effort. The system is ideal for a wide range of data storage environments, including high-security storage applications, replacing tape for entry-level backup, or anywhere large volumes of data need to be stored quickly and securely and accessed rapidly. The new system utilizes a rugged, reliable disk cartridge that backs up like a tape drive and features the performance advantages of a disk-to-disk system. The docking station runs the firmware which controls the operation of the entire system. The firmware will be periodically updated by our client in order to fix the reported issues and/or enhancing the capabilities or functionalities. The updated firmware could be uploaded to the docking station using the Firmware Upload Utility.</p>
                                <p  id="sub-h">Challenges & Requirements</p>
                                <p>The eSATA RHDD accepts cartridges built with a SATA 2.5" or SSD Hard Disk Drives. The product has two primary components, docking station (dock) and cartridge (enclosure over a SATA HDD). The dock has an external SATA connector enabling connection to a PC SATA/ESATE port. The dock has a controller/bridge chip that interfaces with the PC SATA host controller as well as the SATA HDD cartridge. The microcontroller sitting inside this RHDD needs a firmware which drives the RHDD. This firmware sits on the flash available as part of this microcontroller. The firmware uploading utility is capable of re-flashing the micro-controller with the firmware binary provided by the end user. The firmware uploading utility scans for all eSATA devices which matches the vendor and product ID of our client and displays the list of connected devices in the front end UI. User could select the RHDD drive and also provide the new firmware binary file. Typically, the firmware uploading utility will be used to upgrade the existing firmware with the new version of the firmware. The firmware uploading utility front end is developed in Java which communicated with the utility's back end using JNI. The back end communicates with the underlying SATA device driver for the microcontroller for re-flashing the micro-controller. The utility communicates with the underlying device driver through the utility's native libraries developed for both Windows and Linux environment which in turn sends corresponding SCSI commands with appropriate page code and CDB data using native IOCTL APIs to perform requested operations on the device. The front end UI extracted the details of the dock and cartridge of each connected device such as current firmware version, dock and cartridge's vendor ID, product ID, Serial Number, OEM, cartridge capacity, etc. The utility also allows user to perform diagnostics tests on the device to monitor overall device status (check status of LED, Sensors, Dock, Cartridge, etc). The utility targeted to be used by three levels of users: End user, Manufacturer and the Engineering team each of them having access to only those features that were provided for their level. Since, the device was still in the manufacturing process, the utility was developed using Altera FPGA board that needed to be configured with the actual firmware which will be used in the final device.</p>
